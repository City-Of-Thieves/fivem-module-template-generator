# GTA FiveM Module Template Generator

This will ask a series of questions in order to obtain information on the mod you are creating for your GTA server, then crate the folder structure along with any relavent files that are needed along with linking them together if necessary (ex html linked with css and your script file). It will include a .gitignore file and with the fxmanifest.lua file that is also needed.
